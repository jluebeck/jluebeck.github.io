I'm a recently-minted bioinformatics PhD working with Vineet Bafna at UC San Diego. We study genomic focal amplifications and develop methods to detect and reconstruct them using a variety of different technologies. Specifically, I study circular extrachromosomal DNA and breakage-fusion-bridges to understand their structures and the consequences of these amplifications in cancer.

### Some stuff I work on
The following tools are available on [Github](https://github.com/jluebeck).

##### 1. Detecting and reconstructing focal amplifications:
- [**AmpliconArchitect**](https://github.com/jluebeck/AmpliconArchitect): Detect and analyze focal amplifications with NGS data (I am a maintainer of this codebase).
- [**AmpliconReconstructor**](https://github.com/jluebeck/AmpliconReconstructor): Reconstruct focal amplifications using NGS and optical mapping data.
- [**AmpliconClassifier**](https://github.com/jluebeck/AmpliconClassifier): Classify AA outputs to detect ecDNA, BFB, etc.
- [**PrepareAA**](https://github.com/jluebeck/PrepareAA): A quickstart wrapper for AA + other upstream/downstream analysis utilities.

##### 2. Alignment of optical maps:
- [**FaNDOM**](https://github.com/jluebeck/FaNDOM): Fast, open-source aligner for Bionano optical map data (co-developer).
- [**SegAligner**](https://github.com/jluebeck/AmpliconReconstructor): Sensitive alignment of small reference genome segments to optical map contigs (part of AmpliconReconstructor).

##### 3. Visualization of focal amplifications:
- [**CycleViz**](https://github.com/jluebeck/CycleViz): Visualize focal amplifications detected by AmpliconArchitect and AmpliconReconstructor.

##### 4. Simulation projects:
- [**ReactionDiffusionSimulator**](https://github.com/jluebeck/ReactionDiffusionSimulator): Simulating and visualizing Turing patterns.
- [**ecSimulator**](https://github.com/jluebeck/ecSimulator): For simulating focal amplifications from the ground up.
