Currently a  Ph.D. student with Professor Vineet Bafna at UC San Diego. I study genomic focal amplifications and develop methods to reconstruct them, using a variety of different technologies. Specifically, I study circular extrachromosomal DNA and breakage-fusion-bridges to understand their structures and the consequences of these amplifications in cancer.

Background
======
- Ph.D., Bioinformatics & Systems Biology, University of California, San Diego (In progress).
- M.S., Computer Science, University of California, San Diego (2019).
- B.S., Applied Computational & Mathematical Sciences (Biological & Life Sciences track), University of Washington, Seattle (2015).

Projects
======
1. Reconstruction of focal amplifications
- **AmpliconArchitect**: Detect and analyze focal amplifications with NGS data (maintainer).
- **PrepareAA**: Standardize the process of using AmpliconArchitect.
- **AmpliconReconstructor**: Reconstruct focal amplifications using NGS data and optical mapping.

2. Alignment of optical maps
- **SegAligner**: Sensitive alignment of small reference genome segments to optical map contigs.
- **FaNDOM**: Fast, open-source aligner for Bionano optical map data (co-developer).

3. Visualization of focal amplifications
- **CycleViz**: Visualize focal amplificaitons detected by AmpliconArchitect and AmpliconReconstructor.

4. Simulation projects:
- **ecSimulator**: For simulating focal amplifications from the ground up.
- **ReactionDiffusionSimulator**: Simulating and visualizing Turing patterns.
