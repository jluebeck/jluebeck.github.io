Bioinformatics postdoc working with Vineet Bafna at UC San Diego. We study extrachromosomal DNA and genomic focal amplifications - developing methods to detect and reconstruct them using a variety of different technologies. I also lead the [AmpliconSuite GitHub organization](https://github.com/AmpliconSuite) and manage the development of [AmpliconRepository.org](https://ampliconrepository.org/).

### Tools I built or maintain
The following tools are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jluebeck):

#### 1. Detecting and reconstructing focal amplifications:
- [**AmpliconArchitect**](https://github.com/jluebeck/AmpliconArchitect): Detect and analyze focal amplifications with NGS data. Originally developed by Viraj Deshpande - I am a maintainer of this codebase.
- [**AmpliconReconstructor**](https://github.com/jluebeck/AmpliconReconstructor): Reconstruct focal amplifications using NGS and optical mapping data.
- [**AmpliconClassifier**](https://github.com/jluebeck/AmpliconClassifier): Classify AA outputs to detect ecDNA, BFB, etc.
- [**AmpliconSuite-pipeline**](https://github.com/jluebeck/PrepareAA): A quickstart wrapper for AA + other upstream/downstream analysis utilities.

#### 2. Alignment of optical maps:
- [**FaNDOM**](https://github.com/jluebeck/FaNDOM): Fast, open-source aligner for Bionano optical map data (co-developer).
- [**SegAligner**](https://github.com/jluebeck/AmpliconReconstructor): Sensitive alignment of small reference genome segments to optical map contigs (part of AmpliconReconstructor).

#### 3. Visualization of focal amplifications:
- [**CycleViz**](https://github.com/jluebeck/CycleViz): Visualize focal amplifications detected by AmpliconArchitect and AmpliconReconstructor.

#### 4. Simulation projects:
- [**ReactionDiffusionSimulator**](https://github.com/jluebeck/ReactionDiffusionSimulator): Simulating and visualizing Turing patterns.
- [**ecSimulator**](https://github.com/jluebeck/ecSimulator): For simulating ecDNA genome structures from the ground up.
